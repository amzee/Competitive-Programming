//Problem : 3SPLIT

//This is a typical leaf cutting problem , where you have to divide the whole tree into 3 parts
//Now if there are n edges you can cut them in nC2 ways
//First you have to find out which one are leaves , in simple words you have to find out an order in which you can cut or 
//you can say put 2 cuts , now if a leaf is not cut it must be added to its parent
//Take the given example
// 1        5
//  \      /
//   3 -- 4
//  /      \
// 2        6
// Now the order to cut the tree will be first , the leaves that is nodes with 1 edges
// which is 1 , 2 ,5 , 6
// 3 and 4 remain , let us add them to the queue , 1(3) , 2(3) ,5(4),6(4),3(4),4(null) , the nodes in brackets are their parents
// Ok as far as the solution goes lets cut the 3(4) edge and 5(4) edge
// It will go like this:
// First we will traverse through the genarated array , we are no cutting 1(3) so
//          5
//         /
//  1+3 -- 4
//  /      \
// 2        6
// We are also no going to cut 2(3)
//            5
//           /
// 2+1+3 -- 4
//           \
//            6
// Ok we are cutting 5(4)
//            5
//           
// 2+1+3 -- 4
//           \
//            6
// We are not going to cut 6(4)
//            5
//           
// 2+1+3 -- 4+6
// We are going to cut the 3(4) edge
// Hence the graph is divided like this
// (2+1+3)--(4+6)--(5) , which is the solution , but before looking at the solution , I think you must try it once , now
